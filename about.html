<h3><a onclick="show(1)">This Program</a></h3>
<div id="1" class="style collapse">
	<div class="label">Title</div> <div>Decrypt</div><br />
	<div class="label">Author</div> <div>Leanne Keeley</div><br />
	<div class="label">About</div> <div>I wrote this site to take the leg (or hand) work out of decrypting substitution ciphers. It will perform substituions for you according to a specified caesar shift, or manually input substitutions for individual letters. It will also generate statistics useful in cracking substitution ciphers and a few other useful functions.<br /><br />
	It can be used just as well to encode text with a substitution cipher.<br /><br />
	The language I used was JavaScript, which I chose because it will run on any browser without a complier.</div>
</div>
<h3><a onclick="show(2)">Solve</a></h3>
<div id="2" class="style collapse">
	<div class="label">Solve Manually</div> <div>This button brings up a table of letters with inputs for each which will take substitutes. On Go, it will perform the input substitutions on the text in the CipherText input box and print it to the PlainText box. If the substitute for a letter was not specified it prints this letter as a dash. I have found that, when cracking substitution ciphers manually, I want to try each letter substitution individually before deciding on the next substitution. This allows me to slowly build up words and notice quickly if one subsitution seems incorrect. I want to know that there is a letter there, but it is confusing to see a mixture of ciphertext and plaintext in the same paragraph, hence this functionality. If anything but a single letter is put in the substitute inputs, the program will print an error message and not try to perform a the substitution.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Caesar Shift</div> <div>This button brings up an input that will take a number between -26 and 26. Each letter in the CipherText is given a number corresponding to its placement in the alphabet. (A = 1, N = 14, Z = 26, etc.) On Go, the program adds the number in the input box to each letter's number, then prints out the new letter in the PlainText box. If anything other than a number between -26 and 26 is entered into the input box, the program will print an error message and will not try to perform the substitution.</div>
</div>
<h3><a onclick="show(3)">Tools</a></h3>
<div id="3" class="style collapse">
	<div class="label">Clear</div> <div>This button clears all inputs and hides hides all the different menus and info divisions.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Show Statistics</div> <div>This link brings up a list of statistics on the makeup of the text in the CipherText box. First is a table containing each letter found in the CipherText and the number of instances of that letter found. The table is ordered by frequency of letter. At the bottom of the table is the total number of letters found in the CipherText. Below the table is the total count of characters in the CipherText, including spaces, punctuation, numbers, and any other character.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Reverse to Encrypt</div> <div>This link allows you to reverse the decryption process to encrypt text by the same method. For example: if you have just decrypted a message from "NFTTBHF" to "MESSAGE" by a ceasar shift of 25, by using this button, you can encrypt messages by the same process that "MESSAGE" was originally encrypted with. So you could encrypt "RECEIVED" to "SFDFJWFE". This button also switches the labels on the CipherText and PlainText boxes for clearer identification. If the program cannot find a method by which you have been decrypting, it will state that. If there is an error in the method, it will print the same errors that it would have if you tryed to decrypt something.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Copy PlainText to CipherText</div> <div>This link simply takes the text from inside the PlainText box (the box on the right) and copies it into the CipherText box (on the left). Hopefully this is useful if you want to decrypt or encrypt anything that with multiple layers. Or if you wish to encrypt by a new method something you just encrypted.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Blocks of 5</div> <div>It is common for alphabetic code to be presented in "words" of five characters each. This prevents anyone from using the length and arrangement of various words as a clue to decyrpt it. This link takes the text in the PlainText box (on the right) and organized it into groups of five with spaces between. It also removes all non-alphabetic characters from the text.</div>
