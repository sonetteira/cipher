	<div class="label">About</div> <div>I wrote this site to take the leg (or hand) work out of decrypting (or encrypting) substitution ciphers. It will perform substituions for you according to a specified Caesar shift, or manually input substitutions for individual letters. It will also generate statistics useful in cracking substitution ciphers and a few other useful functions.<br /><br />
	It can be used just as well to encrypt text as to decrypt it.<br><br>
	It is written in JavaScript.</div>
</div>
<h3><a onclick="show(2)">Solve</a></h3>
<div id="2" class="style collapse">
	<div class="label">Solve Manually</div> <div>This button brings up a table of letters with inputs for each which will take letter substitutes. On “Go”, it will perform the input substitutions on the text in the CipherText input box and print it to the PlainText box. If the substitute for a letter was not specified it prints this letter as a dash. I have found that, when cracking substitution ciphers manually, I want to try each letter substitution individually before deciding on the next substitution. This allows me to slowly build up words and notice quickly if one substitution seems incorrect. I want to know that there is a letter there, but it is confusing to see a mixture of ciphertext and plaintext in the same paragraph, hence this functionality. There is also a "Clear" button next to the "Go" button. This will clear all inputs in the table. On “Go”, the program will also print out the alphabet and put a checkmark next to every letter than you are using as a substitute. This allows you to see if a letter is already being used. If you use any letter more than once, it will print out an error, but will allow the substitution. If anything but a single letter is put in any of the substitute inputs, the program will print an error message and not try to perform the substitution.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Caesar Shift</div> <div>This button brings up an input that will take a number between -26 and 26. Each letter in the CipherText is given a number corresponding to its placement in the alphabet. (A = 1, N = 14, Z = 26, etc.) On “Go”, the program adds the number in the input box to each letter's number, then prints out the new letter in the PlainText box. If anything other than a number between -26 and 26 is entered into the input box, the program will print an error message and will not try to perform the substitution.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Key Shift</div> <div>This button brings up an input textarea that will take a string of numbers separated by spaces. Each letter in the CipherText is given a number corresponding to its placement in the alphabet. (A = 1, N = 14, Z = 26, etc.) On “Go”, the program will add the first number in the key to the number of the first letter in the ciphertext, then the second number in the key to the second letter in the ciphertext, and so on. If the end of the key is reached before the end of the ciphertext, the key will be recycled from the beginning. If anything other than a number between -26 and 26 is entered into the input box, the program will print an error message and will not try to perform the substitution.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Vigenere Square</div> <div>This button brings up an input text area that will take an alphabetic key. Each letter in the CipherText is given a number corresponding to its placement in the alphabet. (A = 1, N = 14, Z = 26, etc.) On "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" the program will perform a calculation on the numeric representation of each letter in the ciphertext, then translate those numbers to letters and print out the resulting message. The encryption is done as follows: the key is expanded to match the length of the ciphertext message (including spaces for any non-alphabetic characters). When "Encrypt" is selected, the following equation is performed: Ei = (Pi + Ki) mod 26; for "Decrypt": Di = (Ei - Ki + 26) mod 26; where Ei is an encrypted character at index i, Di is a decrypted character at index i, Pi is the plaintext character at index i, and Ki is the corresponding key character at index i. 26 is the number of letters in the alphabet. For more information on Vigenere Squares, see <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vigenere-cipher/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/vigenere-cipher/</a>.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Transposition Matrix</div> <div>This button will take you to a new screen with inputs for number of rows and columns. If any non-number, or number less than 1 is input, the program will wait until you enter a valid input. On entering valid numbers, the program displays a grid of the appropriate size. The top row and left-most column are for the positions you would like each position to transpose to. For example: if you wish to print “lohle” as “hello” you might have a 1x5 grid with the numbers 3, 5, 1, 4, 2 on the top row, and the number 1 as the left-most row. The program finds the column labeled 1, then the row labeled 1 and prints the letter. Then it finds the row labeled 2 (when there is more than one row) in the column labeled 1 and prints that letter, etc. If any label is repeated or out of range (not between 1 and the number of columns/rows) the program will print a message saying that the inputs are not valid.</div>

<div id="3" class="style collapse">
	<div class="label">Clear</div> <div>This link brings up a list of statistics on the makeup of the text in the CipherText box.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Show Statistics</div> <div>This link brings up a list of statistics on the makeup of the text in the CipherText box.
	<ul><li>First is a table containing each letter found in the CipherText and the number of instances of that letter found. The table is ordered by frequency of letter. At the bottom of the table is the total number of letters found in the CipherText. Below the table is the total count of characters in the CipherText, including spaces, punctuation, numbers, and any other character. After that is printed a list of other statistics if they are applicable to the CipherText.</li>
	<li>Next is a list of <i>runs</i>. In this case a run is a series of letters occurring more than once in the text. Runs of 2, 3, and 4 letters are printed out in alphabetical order, next to each run in parentheses is the number of times that run occurs. In order to qualify as a run, a series of letters must occur more than once, in order. They need not be whole words. For example, if "THE" and "THERE" both occur in the ciphertext, "TH" and "HE" will both show up as runs of 2 and "THE" will show up as a run of 3. "HAT HE" will not count as a run of "THE" because there is a space in between the letters in question.</li>
	<li>Next is a list of <i>pairs of letters</i>. This is a list of each letter pair found in the CipherText. For example, if "INCCRM" is a word in the ciphertext, "CC" is a letter pair. In English, common letter pairs are "ee", "oo", "tt", "ss", "ll", etc.</li>
	<li>Next is a list of <i>single letter words</i>. This is a list of each word in the CipherText which is made up of a single letter. In English, the only common one letter words are "a" and "I". (Roman numerals: I, V, X, L, C, etc. can also look like one letter words.) </li>
	<li>Next is a list of <i>single letters occurring after an apostrophe</i>. For example, if the word "RUP'G" appears in your CipherText, the letter "G" will be selected for this list. In English, letters that commonly appear after apostrophe's are "s", as in "Jane's", and "t", as in "can't".</li>
	</ul></div><br />
	<div class="label">Reverse to Encrypt</div> <div>This link allows you to reverse the decryption process to encrypt text by the same method. For example: if you have just decrypted a message from "NFTTBHF" to "MESSAGE" by a ceasar shift of 25, by using this button, you can encrypt messages by the same process that "MESSAGE" was originally encrypted with. So you could encrypt "RECEIVED" to "SFDFJWFE". This button also switches the labels on the CipherText and PlainText boxes for clearer identification. If the program cannot find a method by which you have been decrypting, it will state that. If there is an error in the method, it will print the same errors that it would have if you tried to decrypt something. When using the Vigenere Square, this function is disabled in favor of the decrypt button that is visible for that option.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Copy PlainText to CipherText</div> <div>This link simply takes the text from inside the PlainText box (the box on the right) and copies it into the CipherText box (on the left). Hopefully this is useful if you want to decrypt or encrypt anything with multiple layers. Or if you wish to encrypt by a new method something you just encrypted.</div><br />
	<div class="label">Blocks of 5</div> <div>It is common for alphabetic code to be presented in "words" of five characters each. This prevents anyone from using the length and arrangement of various words as a clue to decrypt it. This link takes the text in the PlainText box (on the right) and organized it into groups of five with spaces between. It also removes all non-alphabetic characters from the text.</div><br>
	<div class="label">Generate Random Alphabet</div> <div>This option will generate a randomized alphabet and print it into the inputs for the Solve Manually table. This is to allow you to encode text with a random alphabetic substitution.</div>
